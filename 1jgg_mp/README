 1st version with 1JGG.pdb only
--------------------------

> edited, normalized and renumbered 1jgg_mut_2a.pdb to 1jgg.pdb. DNA labelled
as HETATM so modeller won't model 'em.

> mp.pir with all amino acids and 20 '.' in place of nucleotides.

> run align.py and get "mp_1jgg.pir". Repleaced 20 '-' in 1jgg structure with
20 '.' in place of nucleotides. Also duplicated amino acids (it's a homodimer
and modeller deleted one monomer) and fixed header fields so the alignment
matches the PDB.

> run model.py
